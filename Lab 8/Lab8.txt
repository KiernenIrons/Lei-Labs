Q1

The server will have a listener specifically for a client, once a client has connected then that listener stops listening and the server then waits for the client to send information.

The Client only has 1 socket which it uses to connect to the server and send and receive info.

Q2

Packets could be lost because the data is going to be sent even if there is no connection.
